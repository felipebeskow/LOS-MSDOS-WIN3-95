These aren't the original floppy images from Windows 3.1. The contents were
originally bundled together in one ISO image, and had to be split up into
floppy images. Disk 1 is correct, but the following disks didn't have enough
space and the remaining contents overflowed to the following disk. So when
installing Windows you'll need to do some more disk swapping than usual. If it
says "Read Error" mount the next disk, if it asks for a disk number mount that
disk and if it isn't satisfied mount the following disk, etc.
